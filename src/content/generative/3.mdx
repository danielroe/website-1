>An exoplanet _(UK: /ˈɛk.soʊˌplæn.ɪt/, US: /ˌɛk.soʊˈplæn.ɪt/)_ or extrasolar planet is a planet outside the Solar System. The first evidence of an exoplanet was noted in 1917, but was not recognized as such. The first scientific detection of an exoplanet was in 1988; it was confirmed to be an exoplanet in 2012. The first confirmed detection occurred in 1992. As of 1 February 2019, there are 3,976 confirmed planets in 2,971 systems, with 653 systems having more than one planet.

## Coding
Using three.js I created an interactive low poly model of an exoplanet.
The main surface of the planet is brutally skewed and colored with a generated palette of different shades of gray. Using the `THREE.SphereBufferGeometry` class I have managed to efficiently place thirty floating objects spinning and moving in circular orbit.
