> De Stijl (/də ˈstaɪl/; Dutch pronunciation: [də ˈstɛil]), Dutch for "The Style", also known as Neoplasticism, was a Dutch art movement founded in 1917 in Leiden. De Stijl consisted of artists and architects.[1] In a narrower sense, the term De Stijl is used to refer to a body of work from 1917 to 1931 founded in the Netherlands.[2][3] Proponents of De Stijl advocated pure abstraction and universality by a reduction to the essentials of form and colour; they simplified visual compositions to vertical and horizontal, using only black, white and primary colors.

## The algorithm

```javascript title="LinesLinesLines.js"
p.fire = () => {
  p.clear();
  const w = getWh();
  const r = p.random();
  let y;
  for (let index = 0; index < w * 6; index++) {
    p.beginShape();
    p.strokeWeight(1);
    p.stroke(`rgba(250,250,250, ${p.random()})`);
    y = p.noise(index + (r % w)) * w;
    p.line(index % w, 0, index % w, y);
    p.endShape(p.CLOSE);
  }
};
```
