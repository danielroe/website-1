For the past few weeks, I have been exploring p5.js as a prototyping solution for generative artistry. This JavaScript library has a tiny footprint, a clean and declarative API and great documentation.
As a first example, I decided to create a simple abstract vine pattern. Vertices of strokes are randomly created filling the canvas, creating a "noise" texture that looks like unfinished fractals.
