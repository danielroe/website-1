Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise developed by Ken Perlin in 1983 as a result of his frustration with the "machine-like" look of computer-generated imagery (CGI) at the time.
He formally described his findings in a SIGGRAPH paper in 1985 called An image Synthesizer. In 1997, Perlin was awarded an Academy Award for Technical Achievement for creating the algorithm.

## The algorithm
```javascript title="p5-perlin-noise.js"

p.stroke(`rgba(0,0,0,0.4)`);
p.strokeWeight(1);
p.beginShape();

let xOffset = 0.0;
let step = 10;
for (let x = constraints[0]; x < constraints[1] + step / 2; x += step) {
  let y = p.map(p.noise(xOffset, yOffset), 0, 1, constraints[0], constraints[1]);
  p.vertex(x, y);
  xOffset += 0.03;
}
yOffset += 0.01;
p.endShape();
```
