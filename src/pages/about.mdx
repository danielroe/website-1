# Well, hi.

I'm a software engineer, educator and speaker based in Athens, Greece. 
I'm currently working as an independent engineer, helping companies build their products. In the meantime, I'm also developing [Proxima Analytics](https://proxima.so) - an open source, privacy-first analytics platform.

During my career, I've worked with a variety of technologies, from frontend to backend, from mobile to desktop. Recently, I've been focusing on exploring how modern web technologies can get combined with the different mediums of art, electronics and various forms of communication.
You may find some pieces of generative art I've created [on the Art section](/art).

## Selected projects
- [Proxima Analytics](https://proxima.so) - An open source, privacy-first analytics platform.
- [`ploff`](https://github.com/vorillaz/ploff) - A tiny CLI tool to download git repositories, with support for GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket.
- [Plexis](https://github.com/plexis-js/plexis) - A collective replacement for `lodash.string`
- [`@prxm/clickhouse`](https://github.com/proximahq/clickhouse): A Clickhouse client for Node.js
- [rearguard](https://github.com/proximahq/rearguard) - A bunch of utilities built for incoming visitor data.
- [Devicons](https://github.com/vorillaz/devicons) - An iconic font and CSS toolkit for web related actions.
