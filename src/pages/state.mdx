# Transient State

Transient states are some of the most fascinating and dynamic phenomena in the universe. They are fleeting moments of change and transformation that occur across all scales, from the subatomic to the cosmic.

In the subatomic realm, transient states are observed when particles transition between energy levels. These transitions are accompanied by the emission or absorption of energy, such as light or radiation. For example, when an electron moves from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, it emits a photon of light. This process is responsible for many of the colors we see in the universe, such as the red glow of a sunset or the blue light emitted by stars.

## Moving Forward
The analogy of transient states is a bit of a stretch, but most of my life I've trying to add weird and unique context to the things I do. I've decided to move this small piece of the internet into a "transient state", both writing and design wise. A small refactoring in the tech stack, a not-so-new-but-boring redesign, and more writing is in the making.

I've been quite an introvert for most of my work in the past few years, since I couldn't tell if what I was doing was worth sharing or the proper way to do so. Moving foward, I'll try to share more of my work, thoughts, and ideas in a more open way that actually makes sense, and hopefully, it'll be worth your time.

Moving upwards and onwards.

Yours truly,

Theodore.
